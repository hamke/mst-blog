But in reality, it's the opposite.\nWhen you make money your goal, you often can't sustain it for long, or you end up facing unnecessary risks and burnout.\n\nHere's why‚Äîand how to make money come to you naturally.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**1. You Get Trapped by Short-Term Temptations**\n\nWhen money is your goal, you only look for ways to earn it quickly.\nThis makes you abandon opportunities that could create greater value in the long run.\nFor example, if you only focus on high-profit short-term projects,\nyou won't build foundational assets like brand, expertise, and trust.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**2. Motivation Doesn't Last**\n\nMoney is an external reward. At first, it can be a strong motivator, but once you get used to it, the satisfaction drops sharply.\nWhen you hit your target amount‚Äîor fail to grow as much as expected‚Äîyour drive collapses.\nIn contrast, when fun, meaning, and growth are at the center, you can sustain motivation for the long term.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**3. Decision-Making Gets Distorted**\n\nWhen your thinking revolves around money, you focus less on \"Is this right for me?\" or \"Does it align with my strengths?\"\nInstead, you only see \"Will this make money fast?\"\nThis weakens your long-term competitiveness, and can even lead to unethical choices.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**4. Relationships Suffer**\n\nIf you think only about money, it's easy to see people as mere tools.\nWithout trust and strong relationships, you may manage short-term deals but long-term business will be difficult.\nGood relationships and a solid reputation are assets more valuable than money in the long run.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**5. You Miss Inner Growth**\n\nWhen you only focus on money, you tend to neglect intangible assets like experience, learning, and growth.\nBut these assets are what help you survive market changes and crises.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n**Money Is a Result, Not a Goal**\n\nMoney follows when you provide value.\nIf your goal is money, you'll burn out chasing the immediate.\nIf your goal is value, growth, and meaning, money will follow naturally.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüí° Practical Tip - 3 Steps to Make Money Come to You\n\n1. Set Value-Centered Goals\n‚Üí Identify problems you can solve and the changes you want to create\n\n2. Build Expertise & Trust\n‚Üí Even if it doesn't make money right away, accumulate assets that prove your worth over time\n\n3. Design a Revenue Model\n‚Üí Connect your accumulated value and trust to a sustainable income stream\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWhen you live this way, you stop being a \"money chaser\" and become the person money comes to first.\n","tags":["Mindset"],"categories":["Mindset"]},{"title":"The Secret to Growth You Never Knew: Why You Shouldn‚Äôt Help Recklessly","url":"/en/the-art-of-strategic-non-intervention/","content":"\n<center><a href=\"https://www.moneyskilltalk.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hellotblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-image-service-starter-example-img-01-1200.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"MoneySkillTalk\"></a></center>\n\n**The Secret to Growth You Never Knew: Why You Shouldn‚Äôt Help Recklessly**\n\n***\n\n<center><iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay;fullscreen\" src=\"https://onelineplayer.com/player.html?autoplay=false&autopause=false&muted=false&loop=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffi%2Fp4uhuiuo3cvobrnxz222l%2Fthe-art-of-strategic-non-intervention-en.mp4%3Frlkey%3D6obletr1a67cbewjso8bu751l%26st%3Do94x8m6y%26raw%3D1&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotblog.wordpress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2Fmoneyskilltalk-blog-podcast-img-03-1200.jpg&time=true&progressBar=true&overlay=true&muteButton=true&fullscreenButton=true&style=light&quality=auto&playButton=true\" class=\"shadow\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; max-width:600px; aspect-ratio: 1280 / 720;\"></iframe></center>\n\n***\n\n\"Helping isn‚Äôt always a good thing.\"\n\nWhen we see someone struggling, it‚Äôs natural to want to help. Whether it‚Äôs a child groaning over homework, a friend lamenting their failed diet, or a colleague sending an SOS because they‚Äôre stuck at work.\n\nBut is it really always good to reach out a helping hand without hesitation? Sometimes, a hand extended in goodwill can actually block someone‚Äôs growth and independence, and even make relationships awkward.\n\nI, too, have experienced moments where I thought, ‚ÄúWhy did things get awkward when I only tried to help?‚Äù That‚Äôs why today, I want to share five reasons why we shouldn‚Äôt help recklessly.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n## 1. Helping recklessly steals the chance for growth\n\nWhen a young child struggles to solve an English problem, as a parent, you naturally want to give them the answer right away. But pause for a moment.\n\nThe time spent failing, pondering, and trying again is incredibly valuable learning for a child. There‚Äôs far more learning hidden in that struggle than in simply solving a few questions.\n\nTime to think, ways of overcoming challenges, and even the courage to know when to give up ‚Äî these are muscles of independence that no one else can train on their behalf. Remember, helping isn‚Äôt always the best option.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n## 2. Help easily turns into interference\n\nEven if it starts with pure intentions, help can quickly turn into interference.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it like that.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis way is better.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you finished yet?‚Äù\n\nWords like these can instantly sap a person‚Äôs sense of ownership and motivation.\n\nThe sense of accomplishment from solving problems on one‚Äôs own has the power to transform a person‚Äôs life. Often, the greatest help is letting someone experience that taste of handling things independently.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n## 3. It‚Äôs hard to take full responsibility to the end\n\nWe may think we‚Äôre helping others, but ultimately, the journey of action and achievement is one they must walk themselves.\n\nTake dieting, for example.\nNo matter how much you craft meal plans or schedule workouts, in the end, it‚Äôs up to the individual to follow through and maintain consistency. Without adjusting their own pace, they‚Äôre likely to give up quickly.\n\nThe challenge is that people who‚Äôve already mastered something often can‚Äôt hide their frustration, which then becomes a burden and intimidation for the person being helped. ‚ÄúI thought I was helping ‚Äî why has this become so stressful?‚Äù is a thought many helpers have.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n## 4. Even when asked for help, don‚Äôt get swept away blindly\n\nIt‚Äôs the same when someone directly asks, ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù If you let yourself get swept away by their urgency or emotions, you might end up in trouble.\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to help, define clearly how far you‚Äôre willing and able to go, and communicate that with the other person.\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs actually safer for both parties if help is offered as paid work. Helping for free can lead to subtle misunderstandings that ultimately strain or break relationships. If you want to maintain good relationships long-term, it‚Äôs crucial to set boundaries around helping.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n## 5. Sometimes, your own success is the greatest help\n\nIn fact, simply living your own life well and achieving your own successes is often the best form of indirect help.\n\nWhen I exercise diligently,\nwhen I achieve financial success,\nwhen I live positively and healthily,\n\nthat energy radiates outward.\nPeople see me and find courage, thinking, ‚ÄúIf they can do it, so can I.‚Äù\n\nThis kind of indirect influence often creates far greater change than merely helping from the sidelines. Sometimes, it even transforms someone‚Äôs life entirely.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nDirect help isn‚Äôt always the answer\n\nHelping is a wonderful thing.\nBut sometimes that very help can block someone‚Äôs learning and independence or damage relationships.\n\nSometimes the greatest help is quietly watching from afar.\nSometimes it‚Äôs managing your own life and shining brightly.\nNever forget that these can be the most profound forms of support.\n","tags":["AutoMoneyFramework"],"categories":["AutoMoneyFramework"]},{"title":"What are you afraid of losing ?","url":"/en/what-are-you-afraid-of-losing-marcus-aurelius/","content":"\n<center><a href=\"https://www.moneyskilltalk.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hellotblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/moneyskilltalk-blog-marcus-aurelius-face-img-03-1200.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"MoneySkillTalk\"></a></center>\n\n**What are you afraid of losing ?**\n\n***\n\n<center><iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay;fullscreen\" src=\"https://onelineplayer.com/player.html?autoplay=false&autopause=false&muted=false&loop=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffi%2Fzfcgn900b962hcrk7kt83%2Fwhat-are-you-afraid-of-losing-marcus-aurelius-en.mp4%3Frlkey%3Ddm9t0x62kjx333k58jtypiv3v%26st%3Drm6t0lc4%26raw%3D1&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotblog.wordpress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2Fmoneyskilltalk-blog-podcast-img-03-1200.jpg&time=true&progressBar=true&overlay=true&muteButton=true&fullscreenButton=true&style=light&quality=auto&playButton=true\" class=\"shadow\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; max-width:600px; aspect-ratio: 1280 / 720;\"></iframe></center>\n\n***\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.moneyskilltalk.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hellotblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/moneyskilltalk-blog-marcus-aurelius-face-img-round-01-800.png\" style=\"width:150px; max-width:100%; margin-bottom:4rem;\" alt=\"MoneySkillTalk\"></a></center>\n\nWhat are you afraid of losing, when nothing in this world actually belongs to you?\n\nThink of yourself as dead.

Be one!\n\nThere is never any need to get worked up about things you cannot control.\n\nPeople exist for one another.\n\nThe soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.\n\nGet back up when you fail. Celebrate behaving like a human.\n\nThe nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.\n\nLove the hand that fate deals you, and play it as your own.\n\nBe tolerant with others and strict with yourself.\n\nSomeone despises me? That is their problem.\n\nReceive without pride, and let go without attachment.\n\n- Marcus Aurelius, the 16th Emperor of the Roman Empire\n","tags":["AutoMoneyFramework"],"categories":["AutoMoneyFramework"]},{"title":"8 AI ChatBot prompts that will change your business","url":"/en/ai-prompts-for-entrepreneurial-automation/","content":"\n<center><a href=\"https://www.moneyskilltalk.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hellotblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/automoneytalk-motnani-music-backgournd-img-01-2000.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"MoneySkillTalk\"></a></center>\n\n**8 AI ChatBot prompts that will change your business**\n\n***\n\n<center><iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay;fullscreen\" src=\"https://onelineplayer.com/player.html?autoplay=false&autopause=false&muted=false&loop=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffi%2Fsajuuhvxwi9cqfotas75f%2Fai-prompts-for-entrepreneurial-automation-en.mp4%3Frlkey%3Dtj2dvahp80t2csztndngwccm7%26st%3D9gsfiwe7%26raw%3D1&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotblog.wordpress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2Fmoneyskilltalk-blog-podcast-img-03-1200.jpg&time=true&progressBar=true&overlay=true&muteButton=true&fullscreenButton=true&style=light&quality=auto&playButton=true\" class=\"shadow\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; max-width:600px; aspect-ratio: 1280 / 720;\"></iframe></center>\n\n***\n\nAI ChatBot can automate your entire business.\n\nBut only if you use the right prompts.\n\nHere are 8 AI ChatBot prompts that will change everything üëáüëáüëá\n\n=========\n\n1/ Business Model Validation\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"Act as a startup advisor & evaluate my business idea: {briefly describe your idea}.

What are wealthy people lacking?\n\nWealthy individuals often experience emotional, time-related, and trust-related deficiencies rather than financial ones:\n\n- Lack of time: They highly value services or solutions that can \"buy\" them time.\n- Lack of personalized attention: They are drawn to bespoke services that truly understand them.\n- Lack of trustworthy partners or talent: They seek partners who guarantee privacy and high-quality outcomes.\n- Lack of authenticity: They crave genuine relationships, experiences, and content‚Äîfree from pretense.\n- Boredom: They have little interest in the ordinary and seek surprise and exceptional experiences.\n\n***\n\n## 2. What do they want?\n\n- Premium experiences: Luxurious, personalized lifestyle services (e.g., private travel, 1:1 health and mental coaching)\n- Exclusivity: Unique, exclusive experiences, products, and knowledge\n- Time-saving + trust: Experts or systems that solve problems \"on their behalf\"\n- Education for children/successors: Elite education, global exposure, strong personal networks\n- Spiritual fulfillment/self-actualization: Life beyond money‚Äîimpact, values, and purpose\n\n***\n\n## 3. Where can you find them?\n\n### Offline:\n\n- Global forums, charity events, golf courses, yacht clubs, luxury art fairs\n- Premium schools, international school parent groups, global investment summits\n\n### Online:\n\n- Private investment communities, elite networking platforms (e.g., Tiger 21, EO, YPO)\n- Private social media groups, exclusive forums for high-net-worth individuals\n- Luxury brand VIP programs, executive/investor groups on LinkedIn\n\n***\n\n## 4.

The Stoics had an exercise called ‚Äúpremeditatio malorum‚Äù that applied this model**\n\nThe goal was to envision the negative things that could happen.\n\nThey believed that by imagining the worst-case scenario‚Ä¶\n\nThey could make better plans to prevent them.\n\n**2. Elon Musk is a big advocate of inversion thinking**\n\nHe often uses it to avoid pitfalls in his ventures.\n\nHe identifies potential failures early & steers his projects away from common mistakes.\n\n**3. It‚Äôs also a tool Charlie Munger regularly uses.**\n\n‚ÄúAvoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance,‚Äù - he believes.\n\nRather than trying to win, avoid losing.\n\n**4. Why is inversion thinking so powerful?**\n\nAs humans, we‚Äôre better at seeing threats than seeing opportunities.\n\nBy inverting your thinking, you turn complex problems into obvious solutions.\n\nAnother benefit of inversion thinking is its ability to relieve anxiety.\n\nWhen facing a difficult problem, it‚Äôs hard to see the way out.\n\nInversion lets you see situations from a different angle.\n\nWhich allows you to come up with novel and creative solutions.\n\nTake productivity for example.\n\nMany people think they need a complex system or mental stimulants to work better.\n\nBut when you invert the question‚Ä¶\n\n\"How can I make sure I get nothing done today?\"\n\nThe solution becomes simple: Leave your phone in another room.\n\nAnother example: Building a relationship.\n\n**What behaviors will ruin a relationship?**\n\nJudgment.\nLack of communication.\nNot respecting the other person. \n\nBy inverting the question, you can easily see how to avoid a bad relationship.\n\nOr in the context of a business‚Ä¶\n\n**What behaviors would ruin a business?**\n\nHaving a bad product.\nNot promoting your stuff.\nGiving customers a poor experience.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to see how to grow a business, easy to see how you can destroy one.\n\nHere‚Äôs **how you can apply Inversion Thinking in your life**:\n\n1. Find the problem\n2. Identify the desired outcome\n3. Invert it by asking what would prevent that goal from happening\n4. Plan to avoid those actions\n\nInversion Thinking is a powerful tool of many great thinkers.\n\nIt‚Äôs counterintuitive.\n\nIt takes time & energy to tackle problems from a different viewpoint.\n\nBut when you master it, you‚Äôll be able to see things you couldn‚Äôt see before.","tags":["Mindset"],"categories":["Mindset"]},{"title":"How much do I think like a rich person?","url":"/en/54-rules-the-rich-play-by/","content":"\n<center><a href=\"https://www.moneyskilltalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://hellotblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/moneyskilltalk-rules-the-rich-play-by-image-01-1200.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"MoneySkillTalk\"></a></center>\n\nI asked a billionaire what separates the rich from the rest.\n\nHis answer?\n\n‚ÄúWe play **a game no one else knows exists**.‚Äù\n\n***\n\n<center><iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay;fullscreen\" src=\"https://onelineplayer.com/player.html?autoplay=false&autopause=false&muted=false&loop=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffi%2Ftmpgle4a95o436h5zb7ln%2F54-rules-the-rich-play-by-en.mp4%3Frlkey%3Dppnbkngp60jxpzado6w8b82lk%26st%3Dmpsp1m5w%26raw%3D1&poster=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotblog.wordpress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2Fmoneyskilltalk-blog-podcast-img-03-1200.jpg&time=true&progressBar=true&overlay=true&muteButton=true&fullscreenButton=true&style=light&quality=auto&playButton=true\" class=\"shadow\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; max-width:600px; aspect-ratio: 1280 / 720;\"></iframe></center>\n\n***\n\n**How much do I think like a rich person?**\n\n1.
